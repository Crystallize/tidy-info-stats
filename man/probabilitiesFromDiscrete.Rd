\title{Helper function to calculate probability from discrete data in a tidy friendly manner}
\usage{
probabilitiesFromDiscrete(df, groupVars, countVar = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing columns defining class of observations of discrete variable X and either one row per observation, 
or a count of observations for each of the observed values of X. 
df may also be grouped and in which case the grouping is preserved in the result.}

\item{groupVars}{the datatable column(s) defining the class of the observation quoted by vars(...)}

\item{countVar}{the datatable column containing the observed frequency of the event X. If this is missing the row count will be used instead.}
}
\value{
A summary datatable with possible values of X and the total (N), the total count of that group (N_x) the probability (p_x), and self information (I_x) associated with the value of X
}
\description{
The purpose of this is to calculate the probabilities of events from discrete data. 
This function is useful when you have either a set of observations of its occurrence, 
containing non-unique x events, or you have a counts of their events where 
each row has the type of observation of X=x and the countVar column contains the counts of the event.
