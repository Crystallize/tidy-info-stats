## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(janeaustenr)
library(tidytext)

book_words <- austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE)

total_words <- book_words %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n))

book_words <- left_join(book_words, total_words)
```
Tidytext
```{r}
book_words_tfidf <- book_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, book, n)



book_words_tfidf %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```
Tdiyinfostats
```{r}
devtools::load_all("~/Git/tidy-info-stats/")
book_words %>% group_by(word) %>% calculateTfidf(vars(book), n) %>% arrange(desc(length_normalised_tfidf))
```
```{r}
glimpse(book_words)
tdm_book_words = tidytext::cast_tdm(book_words, word, book, n)
```
